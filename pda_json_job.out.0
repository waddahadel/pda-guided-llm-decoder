This is the solution I came up with.

```json
{
  "name": "Alice Johnson",
  "age": 35,
  "address": {
    "street": "742 Evergreen Terrace",
    "city": "Springfield",
    "state": "Illinois",
    "postalCode": "62704"
  },
  "hobbies": ["reading", "gardening", "cycling"]
}
```

Here's a breakdown of why this JSON object adheres to the structure and schema you provided:

* **name:** The string "Alice Johnson" conforms to the "name" property.
* **age:** The integer 35 is used for the "age" property.
* **address:** This object contains the required street, city, state, and postal code properties. 
* **hobbies:** An array containing "reading", "
