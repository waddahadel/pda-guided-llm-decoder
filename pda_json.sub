# (2) Use a Miniconda image that comes with Python, pip, and Conda.
docker_image = continuumio/miniconda3

# (3) The executable is our dedicated JSON shell script

# (4) Define the resource requirements for the job
request_gpus = 1
request_cpus = 8
request_memory = 32GB

# (5) Tell Condor to mount your /home directory inside the container
+WantGPUHomeMounted = true

# (6) Define unique output files for this experiment
output = pda_json_job.out.$(Process)
error = pda_json_job.err.$(Process)
log = pda_json_job.log.$(Process)

# (7) Queue the job to run one time
